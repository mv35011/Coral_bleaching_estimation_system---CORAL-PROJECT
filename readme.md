## üåä Project Vision

**Project CORAL** aims to develop an intelligent, data-driven tool to forecast coral bleaching events for critical reef ecosystems around India. By synthesizing satellite data with machine learning, this project will provide a functional early warning system, demonstrating a powerful application of Green Tech to a pressing environmental challenge.

## üö® The Problem: A Silent Crisis

Coral reefs are vital marine ecosystems, but they are under severe threat from climate change. Rising sea temperatures cause **coral bleaching**, a stress response that can lead to mass coral mortality. Predicting these events is crucial for conservation efforts, but requires the analysis of complex, multi-variate environmental data.

---

## üí° Our Solution: A Predictive Framework

We are building an **interactive web application** that allows a user to select a coral reef location and receive an AI-generated risk assessment for bleaching. The system will process a suite of oceanographic variables to generate a clear, actionable prediction.

**The final output will be a predicted coral bleaching percentage, presented with a color-coded risk level (Low, Medium, High).**

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Data Flow

Our architecture is designed for modularity and rapid development, ensuring a functional end-to-end pipeline.

### Data Flow Steps:

1. **Frontend Interaction**: A user interacts with a Folium map embedded in a Streamlit web application to select a reef location (e.g., Andaman Islands).

2. **Backend Data Acquisition**: The system queries public APIs from NOAA and Copernicus Marine Service for the latest environmental data corresponding to the selected coordinates (SST, DHW, pH, Salinity).

3. **Data Preprocessing**: The fetched data is cleaned, normalized using a pre-fitted StandardScaler, and structured into a feature vector.

4. **AI Model Inference**: This feature vector is fed into our trained Scikit-learn `GradientBoostingRegressor` model.

5. **Frontend Visualization**: The model's prediction (e.g., "45% Bleaching Risk") is sent back to the Streamlit UI and displayed to the user with supporting charts and risk indicators.

## üìä The Data Plan: A Two-Phase Strategy

Acquiring high-quality "ground-truth" data is the primary challenge in environmental AI. To mitigate this risk and ensure project success, we are adopting a **two-phase approach**.

### Phase 1: The Heuristic-Based Prototype

**Proof of Concept**

This phase focuses on building a fully functional prototype to validate our architecture and modeling approach, even without real-world bleaching observations.

**Problem**: Machine learning models cannot be trained without a target variable (y). The principle of "Garbage In, Garbage Out" means using purely random dummy data would yield a meaningless model.

**Our Solution**: We will generate a scientifically-defensible proxy target variable using a heuristic based on NOAA's official Degree Heating Week (DHW) alert levels.

| DHW Value (Heat Stress) | NOAA Alert Level | Heuristic Observed_Bleaching_% (Our Proxy Label) |
|-------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| DHW = 0 | No Stress | Random value between 1-5% |
| 0 < DHW < 4 | Bleaching Watch/Warning | Random value between 10-30% |
| 4 ‚â§ DHW < 8 | Alert Level 1 (Bleaching Likely) | Random value between 30-60% |
| DHW ‚â• 8 | Alert Level 2 (Mortality Likely) | Random value between 60-90% |

This approach allows our model to learn the complex, non-linear relationships between various environmental inputs and a logically sound, risk-stratified output. This prototype will be fully functional and serve as the basis for our engagement with academic experts.

### Phase 2: The Ground-Truth Model

**The Ultimate Goal**

With the functional prototype in hand, our primary goal is to replace the heuristic labels with real-world field survey data.

**Action Plan**:

- Conduct a time-boxed, intensive literature review of academic papers on Indian coral reefs.
- Identify and contact marine biologists and oceanographic institutions (NIO, ZSI) to request historical bleaching survey data for academic purposes.
- If successful, retrain our `GradientBoostingRegressor` model on this ground-truth data to achieve a higher level of predictive accuracy.
